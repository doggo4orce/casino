-write unit tests for unique_id
-go back to finish testing for entity_data
-go back to structs.py and look at which other classes can be moved 
elsewhere or maybe even (olc stuff for one?)
-eventually, structs.py should contain only the definition of dataclasses 
that use non-custom datatypes (so that any file can import it)
