TODO: factor this out of preferences and pc_save_data?

possibility:

-fields(dataclass)

-numeric(fields)
-boolean(fields)
-textual(fields)

-aggregate
  -numeric
  -boolean
  -textual

another possibility:

class save_data:
  -numeric(fields)
  -boolean(fields)
  -textual(fields)

class pc_save_data(save_data):
  pass

class pc_pref_data(save_data):
  pass


TODO:  go back and thoroughly check formatting and testing for all these files one by one
because i've been moving stuff around without doing testing followups for all the inner
classes
  -X namelist_data (add remove_all method)
  -X entity_data
  -X entity_proto_data
  -X obj_proto_data (now inherits from entity_proto_data)
  -X npc_proto_data (now inherits from entity_proto_data)
  -object_data


game ideas:
-----------

archer, when you start a fight, enemies are immediately affected by a debuf called AWAY, which takes 3 seconds to wear off, they cant hit you until it wears off and it simulates them travelling to get to you

but when someone attacks an archer, this doesn't happen, unless you have the SNEAK ability
